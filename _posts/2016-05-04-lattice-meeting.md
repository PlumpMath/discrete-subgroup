Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are an indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to build lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *04 May 2016* — is aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices, with a long-term goal of cross-fertilisation between the two fields. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format that will hopefully encourage interaction.

## Talks ##

### <span>10:30–12:00 | Cong Ling:</span> TBD ###

### <span>13:30–15:00 | Nigel Smart:</span> Post-Quantum Cryptography ###

### <span>15:00–16:30 | Alister Burr:</span> TBD ###

### <span>16:30–18:00 | Martin Albrecht:</span> A Subfield Lattice Attack on Overstretched NTRU Assumptions ###

> We present work which exploits the presence of a subfield to solve the NTRU problem for large moduli $q$: norming-down the public key $h$ to a subfield may lead to an easier lattice problem, and any sufficiently good solution may be lifted to a short vector in the full NTRU-lattice.
>
> We restrict ourselves to choices of dimensions $n(λ)$ and modulus $q(λ)$ that were previously thought to offer resistance against attacks in time exponential in the security parameter $λ$. For any super-polynomial $q(λ)$, the subfield attack can be made sub-exponential in $λ$, or even polynomial as $q(\lambda)$ gets larger.
>
> The subfield lattice attack directly affects the asymptotic security of the bootstrappable homomorphic encryption schemes LTV and YASHE. It also makes GGH-like Multilinear Maps vulnerable to principal ideals attacks — therefore leading to a quantum break — and almost vulnerable to a statistical attack a-la Gentry-Szydlo. No *encodings of zero* nor *zero-testing parameter* are required.

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.

2. please send us an email at <c.ling@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size
   of the room fits with the number of participants.
