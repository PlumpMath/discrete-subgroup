Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *18 January 2017* — is aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices, with a long-term goal of building a synergy of the two fields. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format that will hopefully encourage interaction.

### <span>[Wouter Castryck](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~castryck/):</span> Remarks on the error distributions in ring-based LWE###

The existing literature contains several ring-based variants of the Learning With Errors problem, all of which are often referred to as Ring-LWE, a habit which has led to some confusion in the recent past. The main difference lies in the choice of the probability distribution from which the errors are to be sampled. We will briefly compare the main versions, such as Poly-LWE and “proper” Ring-LWE as introduced by Lyubashevsky et al., and discuss some pitfalls that arise when mixing things up. This is joint work with Ilia Iliashenko and Frederik Vercauteren.

### <span>[Ana Costache](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/ana-costache/index.html):</span> Fixed Point Arithmetic in SHE Scheme ###

We begin by introducing the context of ring-based somewhat homomorphic schemes and discuss some
optimisations. This starts with introducing the RLWR hard problem and its relation to lattices. We
investigate fixed-point arithmetic in ring-based homomorphic encryption schemes. Downlin et al.
present two fixed-point numbers representations; we analyse and show them to be isomorphic, by
presenting an explicit isomorphism between the two. Given input bounds on fixed-point numbers and
scalars, we achieve lower bounds for the ring dimensions needed to support complex homomorphic
operations. As an application, we investigate homomorphic image processing and, specifically,
Fourier Transforms.

## Registration ##

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.
2. Please send us an email at <c.ling@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size
   of the room fits with the number of participants.
