Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *21 September 2016* — is aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices, with a long-term goal of building a synergy of the two fields. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format that will hopefully encourage interaction.

## Program ##

We have four talks scheduled.

### <span>10:30–12:00 | [Jean-Claude Belfiore](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~belfiore/):</span>  TDB###

### <span>13:00–14:30 | [Daniel Dadush](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/):</span> TBD ###

### <span>15:00–16:30 | [Antonio Campello](http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~campello/):</span> TBD ###

### <span>17:00–18:30 | Dan Shepherd:</span> TBD ###

## Venue ##

TBD

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.

2. Please send us an email at <martin.albrecht@royalholloway.ac.uk>,
   so that the size of the room fits with the number of participants.
