London-ish Lattice & Coding Meeting: 18 January 2017
---
Dear all,

Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern
cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are
indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction
codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they
are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security,
better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new
functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *18 January 2017* — is aimed at connecting the two
communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices, with a
long-term goal of building a synergy of the two fields. It will consist
of several talks on related topics, with a format that will hopefully
encourage interaction.

### Wouter Castryck: Remarks on the error distributions in ring-based LWE ###

The existing literature contains several ring-based variants of the Learning With Errors problem, all of which are often referred to as Ring-LWE, a habit which has led to some confusion in the recent past. The main difference lies in the choice of the probability distribution from which the errors are to be sampled. We will briefly compare the main versions, such as Poly-LWE and "proper" Ring-LWE as introduced by Lyubashevsky et al., and discuss some pitfalls that arise when mixing things up. This is joint work with Ilia Iliashenko and Frederik Vercauteren.

# Registration #

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.

2. Please send us an email at <c.ling@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size
   of the room fits with the number of participants.

Best,
Cong Ling and Martin Albrecht
