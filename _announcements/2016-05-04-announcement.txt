London-ish Lattice & Coding Meeting: 4 May 2016
---
Dear all,

Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern
cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are an
indispensable mathematical tool to construct powerful error-correction
codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they
are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better
asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new
functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

We are setting up meetings on lattices in cryptography and coding in the
London area.[^1] These meetings are inspired by similar meetings held in
Lyon[^2] and are aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with
a common interest in lattices, with a long-term goal of building a
synergy of the two fields.

The meetings will consist of several talks on related topics, with a
format that will hopefully encourage interaction (e.g. longer than usual
time slots).

# Registration #

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.

2. Please send us an email at <c.ling@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size
   of the room fits with the number of participants.

Best,
Cong Ling and Martin Albrecht
