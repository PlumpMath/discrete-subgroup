Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

These meetings are inspired by [similar meetings](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/damien.stehle/LATTICE_MEETINGS.html) held in Lyon and are aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices, with a long-term goal of building a synergy of the two fields.

## Organisers & Contact

The London-ish Lattice Coding & Crypto meetings are organised by [Martin Albrecht](http://malb.io) and [Cong Ling](http://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~cling/). If you have any queries, please get in touch with either or both organisers.
