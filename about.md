Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are an indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to build lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

These workshops are aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices, with a long-term goal of cross-fertilisation between the two fields.

## Organisers & Contact

These workshops are organised by [Martin Albrecht](http://malb.io) and [Cong Ling](http://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~cling/). If you have any queries, please get in touch with either or both organisers.
